Database Management and ETL in PostgreSQL

Tasks: 
1. Write a SQL code that creates the tables to hold your report sections. 
2. Write a SQL query that will extract the raw data needed for the Detailed section of your report from the source database and verify the dataâ€™s accuracy.
3. Write code for function(s) that perform the transformation(s) 
4. Write a SQL code that creates a trigger on the detailed table of the report that will continually update the summary table as data is added to the detailed table.
5. Create a stored procedure that can be used to refresh the data in both your detailed and summary tables. The procedure should clear the contents of the detailed and summary tables and perform the ETL load process from part C and include comments that identify how often the stored procedure should be executed.
